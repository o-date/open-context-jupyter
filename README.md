Jupyter Notebooks Relating to Open Context (https://opencontext.org) and some other APIs, including Chronicling America and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. These notebooks will help people get started using Open Context in "open science" and reproducible research workfolows. Please feel free to fork and adapt this repo for your own needs. Open Context notebooks originally by Eric Kansa. It seems a bit eclectic, but the patterns should help you also adapt for other APIs you might encounter.
